[Type and/or Issue ID]: Summarize the changes in less than 72 characters
#--------------------------72 characters wide--------------------------#

Because:
 - Explain the reasons you made this change
 - Make a new bullet '-' for each reason
 - Each line should be under 72 characters

Explain exactly what was done in this commit with more depth than the
72 character subject line. Remember to wrap at 72 characters!

Include additional notes or relevant links.
